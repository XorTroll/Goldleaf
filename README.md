<img src="Logo.png" width="150"/>

## What is Goldleaf?

- Goldleaf is a multipurpose tool, specialized on title installing from NSP packages, but with other utilities, such as NAND/SD browsing, 

- You can easily manage title-related stuff, like install titles via NSP packages or uninstall already installed titles.

- If you know what FBI is (related to 3DS homebrew), this is a similar project for Nintendo Switch.

## What can Goldleaf do?

- Browse SD card's files and directories. You can install NSPs from there (`*.nsp` format).

- Browse NAND partitions (SAFE, USER and SYSTEM). You can export files from any of those partitions (directories still not, support will be added soon!).

- Install NSPs from a remote PC, via USB communication.

- Manage currently installed titles, being able to see where are they installed, or uninstalling them.

- Manage currently installed tickets, being able to see the application they belong to, or removing them.

- Show SD card's space, NAND partitions' space and firmware version of the current console.

## Planned support

- Savedata mounting and exploring

- USB-HDD support
